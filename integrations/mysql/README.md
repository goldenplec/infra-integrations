# New Relic Infrastructure Integration for MySQL
New Relic Infrastructure Integration for MySQL captures critical performance metrics and inventory reported by MySQL database.

Data is obtained by querying directly the database for its status and configuration variables to build the reported metrics and inventory.

<!---
See [metrics]() or [inventory]() for more details about collected data and review [dashboard]() in order to know how the data is presented.

## Configuration
It is required to create a user with [replication privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_replication-client). Execute the following command, replacing \<SET_PASSWORD> with selected password.
```bash
$ sudo mysql -e "CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<SET_PASSWORD>';"
$ sudo mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
```

## Installation
* download an archive file for the MySQL Integration
* extract `mysql-definition.yml` and `/bin` directory into `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations`
* add execute permissions for the binary file `nr-mysql` (if required) 
* extract `mysql-config.yml.sample` into `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`

## Usage
This is the description about how to run the MySQL Integration with New Relic Infrastructure agent, so it is required to have the agent installed (see [agent installation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/install-infrastructure-linux)).

In order to use the MySQL Integration it is required to configure `mysql-config.yml.sample` file. Firstly, rename the file to `mysql-config.yml`. Then, depending on your needs, specify all instances that you want to monitor with correct credentials. Once this is done, restart the Infrastructure agent.

You can view your data in Insights by creating your own custom NRQL queries. To do so use the **DatastoreSample** event type and the **MySQL** provider.

## Integration development usage
Assuming that you have the source code and Go tool installed you can build and run the MySQL Integration locally.
* Go to the directory of the MySQL Integration and build it
```bash
$ make
```
* The command above will execute the tests for the MySQL Integration and build an executable file called `nr-mysql` under `bin` directory. Run `nr-mysql` with parameters specifying username and password
```bash
$ ./bin/nr-mysql -username <username> -password <password>
```
* If you want to know more about usage of `./bin/nr-mysql` check
```bash
$ ./bin/nr-mysql -help
```

For managing external dependencies [govendor tool](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) is used. It is required to lock all external dependencies to specific version (if possible) into vendor directory.
